    <p>
      Modify the included project to match the mockups. Feel free to use the included 3rd party libraries if they are useful to you but please don't add any others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Task: Create this page: <a href="mockups/initial.png">mockups/initial.png</a>
    </p>

    <label>Details:</label>

    <ul>
      <li>Only needs to work in the latest version of Chrome.</li>
      <li>Things should line up and look symmetrical but please don't bother measuring. Just estimate heights, widths, padding etc.</li>
      <li>After adding a new celebrity, page should look like this: <a href="mockups/after_addition.png">mockups/after_addition.png</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't worry about persistence or AJAX or anything like that.</li>
          <li>Cards should occur in the order of addition with newest being at the top-left.</li>
          <li>Don't worry about form validation, the photo is optional.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The hover state for a card should look like this (top-left card): <a href="mockups/hover_state.png">mockups/hover_state.png</a></li>
      <li>After clicking the X as shown on hover, the card should be removed from the page, and the other cards should fall into place.</li>
      <li>Photo URL can be to any image on the internet.
        <ul>
          <li>Don't worry about proportionate scaling, just force it to a square.</li>
          <li>If no photo is provided, the default image (included) should be shown</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Q: What would need to be done to make this an actually useful app?</li>
      <li>A: First, it needs to persist the data in some way. It isn't realistic to keep the window open without refreshing at all times. Next, it would be a good idea to refactor this to support other browsers besides the latest version of Chrome. I used some CSS that still isn't supported in older browsers. I would probably then add some validation to the form to prevent broken images. It could also probably use a delay between submits since rapidly adding cards does weird things to the animation. Lastly, I think making the page responsive would make it more useful since right now you can only use the app on desktop.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Q: What did you think of this test?</li>
      <li>A: I thought it was kind of fun! Much better than the redundant algorithm questions that you usually get in interviews. It was also fun to experiment without regards for browser support - it isn't often I have projects that are only required to work in the latest version of Chrome.</li>
